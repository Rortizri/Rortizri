MACHINE LEARNING FUNDAMENTALS


- In this part you will find code related to the fundamentals of Machine Learning. It will be constantly updated with modules to cover the main ML topics


Linear Regression using Gradient Descent.

- Linear Regression fits a linear model with coefficients, to minimize the residual sum of squares between the observed targets in the dataset, and the targets predicted by the linear approximation.
Gradient Descent is an iterative optimization algorithm to find the minimum of a function. Here that function is our Loss Function.
